# SHOW TABLES
In Polars, the `SHOW TABLES` statement is used to list all the tables that have been registered in the current `SQLContext`. When you register a DataFrame with the `SQLContext`, you give it a name that can be used to refer to the DataFrame in subsequent SQL statements. The `SHOW TABLES` statement allows you to see a list of all the registered tables, along with their names.
The syntax for the `SHOW TABLES` statement in Polars is as follows:
```python
SHOW TABLES
```
Here's an example of how to use the `SHOW TABLES` statement in Polars:
 Python
   
```python
# Create some DataFrames and register them with the SQLContext
df1 = pl.LazyFrame(
    {
        "name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"],
        "age": [25, 30, 35, 40],
    }
)
df2 = pl.LazyFrame(
    {
        "name": ["Ellen", "Frank", "Gina", "Henry"],
        "age": [45, 50, 55, 60],
    }
)
ctx = pl.SQLContext(mytable1=df1, mytable2=df2)
tables = ctx.execute("SHOW TABLES", eager=True)
print(tables)
```

In this example, we create two DataFrames and register them with the `SQLContext` using different names. We then execute a `SHOW TABLES` statement using the `execute()` method of the `SQLContext` object, which returns a DataFrame containing a list of all the registered tables and their names. The resulting DataFrame is then printed using the `print()` function.
Note that the `SHOW TABLES` statement only lists tables that have been registered with the current `SQLContext`. If you register a DataFrame with a different `SQLContext` or in a different Python session, it will not appear in the list of tables returned by `SHOW TABLES`.
