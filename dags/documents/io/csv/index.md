# CSV
## Read & write
Reading a CSV file should look familiar:
 
```python
df = pl.read_csv("docs/data/path.csv")
```
Writing a CSV file is similar with the `write_csv` function:
 
```python
df = pl.DataFrame({"foo": [1, 2, 3], "bar": [None, "bak", "baz"]})
df.write_csv("docs/data/path.csv")
```

## Scan
Polars allows you to *scan* a CSV input. Scanning delays the actual parsing of the
file and instead returns a lazy computation holder called a `LazyFrame`.
 
```python
df = pl.scan_csv("docs/data/path.csv")
```

If you want to know why this is desirable, you can read more about these Polars
optimizations here.
