# Concatenation
There are a number of ways to concatenate data from separate DataFrames:
* two dataframes with **the same columns** can be **vertically** concatenated to make a **longer** dataframe
* two dataframes with **non-overlapping columns** can be **horizontally** concatenated to make a **wider** dataframe
* two dataframes with **different numbers of rows and columns** can be **diagonally** concatenated to make a dataframe which might be longer and/ or wider. Where column names overlap values will be vertically concatenated. Where column names do not overlap new rows and columns will be added. Missing values will be set as `null`
## Vertical concatenation - getting longer
In a vertical concatenation you combine all of the rows from a list of `DataFrames` into a single longer `DataFrame`.
 
```python
df_v1 = pl.DataFrame(
    {
        "a": [1],
        "b": [3],
    }
)
df_v2 = pl.DataFrame(
    {
        "a": [2],
        "b": [4],
    }
)
df_vertical_concat = pl.concat(
    [
        df_v1,
        df_v2,
    ],
    how="vertical",
)
print(df_vertical_concat)
```
 

Vertical concatenation fails when the dataframes do not have the same column names.
## Horizontal concatenation - getting wider
In a horizontal concatenation you combine all of the columns from a list of `DataFrames` into a single wider `DataFrame`.
 
```python
df_h1 = pl.DataFrame(
    {
        "l1": [1, 2],
        "l2": [3, 4],
    }
)
df_h2 = pl.DataFrame(
    {
        "r1": [5, 6],
        "r2": [7, 8],
        "r3": [9, 10],
    }
)
df_horizontal_concat = pl.concat(
    [
        df_h1,
        df_h2,
    ],
    how="horizontal",
)
print(df_horizontal_concat)
```
 

Horizontal concatenation fails when dataframes have overlapping columns.
When dataframes have different numbers of rows,
columns will be padded with `null` values at the end up to the maximum length.
 
```python
df_h1 = pl.DataFrame(
    {
        "l1": [1, 2],
        "l2": [3, 4],
    }
)
df_h2 = pl.DataFrame(
    {
        "r1": [5, 6, 7],
        "r2": [8, 9, 10],
    }
)
df_horizontal_concat = pl.concat(
    [
        df_h1,
        df_h2,
    ],
    how="horizontal",
)
print(df_horizontal_concat)
```
 

## Diagonal concatenation - getting longer, wider and `null`ier
In a diagonal concatenation you combine all of the row and columns from a list of `DataFrames` into a single longer and/or wider `DataFrame`.
 
```python
df_d1 = pl.DataFrame(
    {
        "a": [1],
        "b": [3],
    }
)
df_d2 = pl.DataFrame(
    {
        "a": [2],
        "d": [4],
    }
)
df_diagonal_concat = pl.concat(
    [
        df_d1,
        df_d2,
    ],
    how="diagonal",
)
print(df_diagonal_concat)
```
 

Diagonal concatenation generates nulls when the column names do not overlap.
When the dataframe shapes do not match and we have an overlapping semantic key then we can join the dataframes instead of concatenating them.
## Rechunking
Before a concatenation we have two dataframes `df1` and `df2`. Each column in `df1` and `df2` is in one or more chunks in memory. By default, during concatenation the chunks in each column are copied to a single new chunk - this is known as **rechunking**. Rechunking is an expensive operation, but is often worth it because future operations will be faster.
If you do not want Polars to rechunk the concatenated `DataFrame` you specify `rechunk = False` when doing the concatenation.
